# SelfBot
This is a selfbot I use on my personal account. It's mostly for learning purposes, but I also have a lot of images and other misc commands loaded in for use so that I can do things like post commonly used images easily or to post dongers without needing to copy paste them.

### Commands
I've defined `~` to be my prefix in `config.json`, so all commands listed here will be using that prefix
- **~quoteme [text]** Will spit out `text` inside an embed
- **~flipcoin** Will give you a coin flip
- **~lenny** Will give you the lenny donger
- **~eval [js code]** Will evaluate js code. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND USING FOR NOW
